Areawise AQI Overview (Map Visualization): Displays AQI levels for different cities on an interactive map, enabling users to quickly identify highly polluted regions.

AQI Trend Overview (Line Chart): Illustrates the AQI trends from 2015 to 2020, showing a general decline in pollution levels over time.

Top 3 Polluted Cities (Bar Chart): Highlights the three most polluted cities, which are Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna, based on AQI values.

Least 3 Polluted Cities (Bar Chart): Shows the cities with the least pollution levels, including Coimbatore, Shillong, and Aizawl.

Key Pollutant Averages (KPIs): Presents the average levels of major pollutants like CO (Carbon Monoxide), NO (Nitric Oxide), SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide), and PM2.5 (Particulate Matter) for a selected city or overall.

Filters: The dashboard includes a city filter, allowing users to view detailed data for specific locations.
Conclusion
The Air Quality Index Report Dashboard reveals critical insights into pollution levels across Indian cities. While cities like Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna struggle with high pollution, there's a positive decline in AQI trends from 2015 to 2020. Cleaner cities like Coimbatore, Shillong, and Aizawl highlight areas with better air quality. This dashboard provides valuable information to guide efforts in improving air quality and mitigating pollution.
